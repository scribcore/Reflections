What kind of reflections are you considering for remote Git Hub?

  Probably creating a new file
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You will want to check changes to the GitHub repository beforing pulling them into your local repository
