What kind of reflections are you considering for remote Git Hub?

  Probably creating a new file
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You will want to check changes to the GitHub repository beforing pulling them into your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork: Cloning a repository on GitHub
	Clones: To make a copy of repository with auto 'origin' remote repository configured
	Branch: Make a separate area of commits to work with.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It's easier to synch changes in versions when doing 'git push' to the remote
